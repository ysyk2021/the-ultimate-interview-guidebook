### Example 1

As a senior manager in my previous role, I had the opportunity to mentor several junior team members who were interested in advancing their careers. My approach to mentoring involved providing regular feedback and guidance on their performance, as well as identifying opportunities for them to develop new skills and take on additional responsibilities. I also encouraged them to set specific career goals and provided resources and support to help them achieve those goals. As a result of our mentoring relationship, several of my mentees were able to advance into leadership positions within the company.

### Example 2

In my early career, I was fortunate to have a mentor who provided me with guidance and support as I navigated the industry. My mentor helped me identify areas where I needed to develop my skills and provided me with resources and training opportunities to help me improve. They also challenged me to take on new projects and responsibilities that helped me gain valuable experience and exposure. As a result of their guidance and support, I was able to advance my career faster than I would have on my own.

Remember, when answering interview questions about your mentoring experience, provide context for the relationship, discuss your approach to mentoring, highlight the outcome, and show a willingness to learn from mentors. Show that you have effective communication and coaching skills and can provide support and guidance to others to help them achieve their goals. Additionally, demonstrate how you have been receptive to feedback and guidance from mentors in the past, and how it has contributed to your professional growth.
