Here are some sample answers to the question "Can you tell me about a time when you had to make a decision without complete information?"

### Example 1:

In my previous role as a project manager, we were faced with a tight deadline for a critical project. One of our team members unexpectedly fell ill, which affected our timeline and resources.

Without complete information about the extent of the team member's illness and how long they would be out, I had to make a decision quickly about how to proceed with the project. After consulting with other team members and assessing our options, we decided to redistribute the workload and bring in additional resources to meet the deadline.

The decision was successful, and we were able to deliver the project on time. However, I learned from the experience that it's essential to have contingency plans in place and to communicate effectively with all stakeholders when faced with uncertainty.

Overall, I believe that my ability to think critically and act quickly under pressure has prepared me well for this role. I'm confident that I can make informed decisions even when faced with incomplete information.

### Example 2:

In a previous job, we had to decide whether to invest in a new product line without complete market research. We had some initial data, but there was still a lot of uncertainty about customer demand and potential competitors.

To make an informed decision, we gathered as much information as possible from industry reports and consulted with experts in the field. We also conducted a small-scale test launch to gauge customer interest and feedback.

The investment ultimately paid off, and the new product line became one of our most successful offerings. However, I learned from the experience that it's important to balance the need to make quick decisions with the importance of gathering adequate information.

Overall, I believe that my problem-solving skills and ability to weigh different options and assess risks have prepared me well for this role. I'm comfortable making informed decisions under uncertainty and can act quickly to resolve complex issues.
