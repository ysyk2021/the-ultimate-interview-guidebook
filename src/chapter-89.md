### Example 1

In my previous role as a project manager, we experienced unexpected changes to our project timeline due to delays in receiving critical materials from a supplier. To manage this situation, I worked with cross-functional teams to identify potential solutions, such as finding alternative suppliers or adjusting the project timeline. We ultimately decided to adjust the timeline, which required us to pivot our strategy and make some difficult decisions about resource allocation. Through open communication with stakeholders and clear prioritization of tasks, we were able to successfully complete the project on time and within budget.

### Example 2

In a previous role, I was part of a team tasked with launching a new product in a highly competitive market. Midway through the launch process, we received feedback from early adopters that our product had some usability issues that needed to be addressed. To manage this situation, I worked with our design and development teams to identify potential solutions and prioritize fixes for the most critical issues. We were able to pivot our strategy and make adjustments to the product while still meeting our launch deadline. As a result of these efforts, we were able to successfully launch the product and gain market share.
