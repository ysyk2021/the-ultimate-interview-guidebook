I have extensive experience with email marketing and newsletter creation, having worked on several projects in previous roles. In my last position, I was responsible for creating weekly newsletters to keep customers informed about new products and promotions.

Overall, the email campaigns I created had high open rates and resulted in increased website traffic and sales.

I used email marketing software like Hubspot and Marketo to create visually appealing emails that included personalized content based on the recipient's interests and industry. In addition, I conducted A/B testing on subject lines and email content to determine which strategies were most effective at engaging audiences and driving conversions. One successful email campaign I created resulted in a 25% increase in leads generated compared to previous campaigns. I also created monthly newsletters featuring industry news and company updates that were well-received by our subscriber base.
