Sample Answers

### Example 1

"I worked on a project where I had to collaborate closely with a team member who had a very different working style than my own. While I tended to be more detail-oriented and focused on planning, my team member was more spontaneous and preferred to work on tasks as they came up.

To work effectively with my team member, I first made an effort to understand their approach and why it worked well for them. I then communicated my own perspective and the importance of planning and organization. Together, we found a compromise that allowed us to balance our different working styles while still achieving the project's goals.

By leveraging our strengths and finding common ground, we were able to work effectively together and deliver a successful outcome for the project. This experience taught me the importance of communication, empathy, and compromise when working with team members who have different working styles."

### Example 2

"I had to work with a team member who had a very different communication style than my own. While I tended to be more direct and to-the-point, my team member was more inclined to use storytelling and analogies to convey ideas.

To work effectively with my team member, I first made an effort to understand their communication style and how it worked for them. I then adapted my own communication style to better align with theirs, using analogies and stories when appropriate.

By adapting my communication style and finding common ground with my team member, we were able to collaborate more effectively and achieve the project's goals. This experience taught me the importance of adaptability, empathy, and collaboration when working with team members who have different communication styles."
