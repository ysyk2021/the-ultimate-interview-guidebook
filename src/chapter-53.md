### Example 1

I believe that feedback is essential for personal and professional growth and development. My approach to receiving feedback involves remaining open and receptive to input from team members and actively seeking out their perspectives on my performance. When receiving feedback, I make sure to listen actively, ask clarifying questions, and reflect on what I've heard before responding. For example, when a team member provided me with feedback on my leadership style, I thanked them for their input and asked for specific examples of areas where I could improve. I then reflected on their feedback and worked with them to develop a plan to address the areas where I needed to improve. Through this process, I was able to grow as a leader and build stronger relationships with my team members.

### Example 2

In my previous role, I worked on a cross-functional team that required close collaboration and communication with colleagues from different departments. One team member provided me with feedback on my communication style, suggesting that I could be more proactive in sharing updates and information with the team. I appreciated their feedback and immediately began implementing changes to my communication approach. Specifically, I started sending regular status updates to the team and scheduling more frequent check-ins to ensure that everyone was on the same page. As a result of these changes, we were able to improve our communication and collaboration, and the project was a success.
