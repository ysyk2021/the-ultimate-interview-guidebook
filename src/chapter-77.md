### Example 1

I have had a lot of experience with performance evaluations throughout my career. In previous roles, evaluations were typically conducted on an annual basis and included a review of my performance over the past year, feedback from colleagues and managers, and goal-setting for the coming year.

I have always had a positive attitude toward performance evaluations, as I believe they provide valuable feedback and help me identify areas for improvement. I am always willing to receive feedback and take steps to improve my performance.

In terms of goal-setting, I always aim to set SMART goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. By setting clear objectives and tracking my progress, I am able to stay focused on achieving my goals and improving my performance.

One example of a situation where I received feedback and used it to improve my performance was when a colleague gave me feedback on my communication skills. Based on their feedback, I identified areas where I could improve, such as being more concise in my emails and active listening during meetings. By taking action on their feedback, I was able to improve my communication skills and build stronger relationships with my colleagues.

### Example 2

I have had experience with performance evaluations throughout my career, both as an employee and as a manager. Evaluations were typically conducted on an annual or bi-annual basis and included a review of performance over the past year or six months, feedback from colleagues and managers, and goal-setting for the coming year or six months.

I have always viewed performance evaluations as an opportunity for growth and development. I am open to receiving feedback and take it seriously, as I know that it can help me identify areas where I need improvement and can help me grow professionally.

In terms of goal-setting, I believe in setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals. I work collaboratively with my manager to set goals that align with the company's objectives and my personal career aspirations. By tracking progress toward those goals and making adjustments as needed, I am able to stay focused on achieving them.

One example of a situation where I received feedback and used it to improve my performance was when a manager gave me feedback on my time management skills. Based on their feedback, I created a prioritization system and started using time-blocking techniques to manage my workload more effectively. By implementing these changes, I was able to improve my productivity and reduce my stress levels.

Remember, when answering interview questions about your experience with performance evaluations, describe your experience, highlight your attitude toward them, emphasize your approach to goal-setting, and provide examples of situations where you received feedback and used it to improve your performance. Demonstrating your willingness to receive feedback and use it to grow professionally shows that you are committed to continuous improvement and are a valuable asset to any organization.
