Sample Answers
--------------

### Example 1

In my previous role as a marketing manager, I was faced with a difficult ethical decision when a key client asked us to provide false advertising claims about our product. While it would have been easy to comply with the request, I knew that it would be unethical and potentially damaging to the company's reputation. After discussing the situation with my supervisor and legal team, we decided to decline the client's request and instead focus on highlighting the genuine benefits of our product. While we did lose the client, our decision to uphold ethical standards helped to maintain our reputation and integrity in the marketplace.

### Example 2

In a previous role, I was managing a team where one of my employees disclosed confidential information about a client to a competitor. While the employee was remorseful and promised not to do it again, I knew that this behavior could have serious ethical implications for our company and our clients. After consulting with HR and legal teams, we decided to terminate the employee's employment. While it was a difficult decision to make, it was necessary to uphold our ethical standards and protect our clients' confidential information.

Remember, when answering interview questions about difficult ethical decisions, be sure to describe the situation, explain your thought process, describe your decision, and discuss the outcome. Be honest about the challenges you faced and demonstrate your commitment to upholding ethical standards even in difficult circumstances.
