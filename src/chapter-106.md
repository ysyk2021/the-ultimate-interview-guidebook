### Example 1

I have received consistently positive feedback from previous employers, particularly in the areas of collaboration, communication, and attention to detail. For example, my previous manager praised my ability to work effectively with cross-functional teams to achieve project objectives and my strong attention to detail, which enabled me to catch errors before they became major issues.

In another instance, I received positive feedback for my ability to adapt to change and overcome challenges. During a major system implementation project, I was able to work collaboratively with team members to identify and mitigate risks, resulting in a successful launch without any major issues.

My soft skills, such as my communication skills and willingness to collaborate, have contributed to my success in these situations. By staying open to feedback and working collaboratively with others, I am able to achieve business objectives while maintaining positive relationships with my colleagues.

While I have received some constructive feedback in the past, such as needing to improve my time management skills, I have always taken that feedback seriously and worked to address those issues.

### Example 2

Previous employers have praised my strong work ethic, attention to detail, and problem-solving skills. For example, during a particularly challenging project, I was able to identify and resolve a major issue that had been causing delays for several weeks. My manager at the time praised my persistence and ability to think creatively to find a solution.

Another area where I received positive feedback was in my ability to communicate effectively with stakeholders at all levels of the organization. By keeping everyone informed and involved in the decision-making process, I was able to build trust and achieve buy-in for important initiatives.

My soft skills, such as my ability to listen actively and work collaboratively with others, have contributed to my success in these situations. By prioritizing clear communication and teamwork, I am able to achieve business objectives while maintaining positive relationships with my colleagues.

While I have received some constructive feedback in the past, such as needing to improve my public speaking skills, I have always taken that feedback seriously and worked to address those issues.

Remember, when answering interview questions about the feedback you have received from previous employers, describe the feedback you have received, provide examples of situations where you received positive feedback, highlight your soft skills and how they contributed to your success, and be honest about any negative feedback you have received and how you addressed those issues. Demonstrating your ability to work collaboratively, communicate effectively, and solve problems shows that you can achieve business objectives and contribute positively to the workplace.
