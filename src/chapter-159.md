If I disagreed with a decision made by my manager or supervisor, I would first take a step back and consider the reasons behind my disagreement. Then, I would discuss alternative solutions with my manager or supervisor and try to find a solution that works for everyone involved. If we cannot come to an agreement, I would respectfully communicate my concerns and explain why I believe the alternative solution would be better for the team or company.
