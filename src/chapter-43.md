### Example 1

When faced with ambiguity or uncertainty, my approach is to gather as much information as possible and seek input from colleagues or subject matter experts. Once I have a better understanding of the situation, I work to assess the potential risks and opportunities and develop different scenarios for how the situation might unfold. For example, in my previous role, we were facing uncertainty around a major policy change that could have significant implications for our company. To address this, I worked with our legal and compliance teams to gather as much information as possible about the policy change and developed multiple contingency plans to ensure that our company could adapt to different outcomes. As a result of our efforts, we were able to successfully navigate the policy change and minimize its impact on our business.

### Example 2

My approach to handling ambiguity or uncertainty involves staying calm and maintaining a positive attitude, even in challenging situations. One example of this was when I was working on a project that had tight deadlines and unclear requirements. To address this, I worked closely with the project team to clarify the requirements and develop a plan of action. I also made sure to communicate regularly with stakeholders to keep them updated on our progress and address any concerns they had. Through this approach, we were able to successfully complete the project on time and within budget.

Remember, when answering interview questions about handling ambiguity or uncertainty, explain your approach, provide an example, discuss the outcome, and highlight your problem-solving skills.
