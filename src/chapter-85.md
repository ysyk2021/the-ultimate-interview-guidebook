### Example 1

In my previous role as a manager, I was faced with a difficult decision regarding the allocation of resources for two competing projects. One project was a high-priority initiative that had significant potential for revenue growth, while the other was a lower-priority project that was important for maintaining client relationships. After considering the available data and consulting with relevant stakeholders, I ultimately decided to allocate more resources to the high-priority project. While this decision was difficult, I felt it was necessary to prioritize the long-term growth and success of the organization. The outcome of this decision was positive, with the high-priority project exceeding revenue expectations and contributing significantly to the organization's success.

Through this experience, I learned the importance of considering all available data and consulting with relevant stakeholders before making a difficult decision. I also learned the value of prioritizing long-term goals over short-term objectives.

### Example 2

In my previous role as a customer service representative, I was faced with a difficult decision regarding a customer complaint. The customer had received a damaged product and was requesting a full refund, but our company policy only allowed for partial refunds in cases of damage. After considering the available information and consulting with my supervisor, I ultimately decided to provide the customer with a full refund. While this decision went against company policy, I felt it was necessary to prioritize customer satisfaction and maintain a positive relationship with the customer. The outcome of this decision was positive, with the customer expressing gratitude and continuing to do business with our company.

Through this experience, I learned the importance of prioritizing customer satisfaction and maintaining positive relationships with customers. I also learned that sometimes, going against company policy can be necessary to ensure customer satisfaction and loyalty.
