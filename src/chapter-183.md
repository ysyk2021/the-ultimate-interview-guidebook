### Example 1

"I was working on a project that required collaboration across multiple departments and teams within our organization. However, due to the complex organizational structure, it was difficult to identify the right stakeholders and build effective relationships to move the project forward.

To address the situation, I scheduled meetings with key stakeholders from each department to understand their perspectives and identify potential roadblocks. Through active listening and effective communication, we were able to develop a shared understanding of the project's goals and how each department could contribute to its success.

We also worked together to develop a project plan that accounted for the needs and priorities of each team, while also ensuring that we were working towards a common goal. As a result of these efforts, we were able to successfully complete the project on time and within budget, and our organization benefited from improved collaboration and communication across departments. This experience taught me the importance of being adaptable and proactive when navigating complex organizational structures."
