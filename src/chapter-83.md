Sample Answers
--------------

Here are some sample answers to the question "Do you prefer to work independently or as part of a team?"

### Example 1:

I value both independence and collaboration in my work. I find that working independently allows me to focus deeply on tasks and produce high-quality work. At the same time, working as part of a team enables me to leverage the strengths and expertise of others and produce even better results.

For example, in my last role, I was responsible for completing a major project on my own. While I enjoyed the autonomy this provided, I found myself missing the opportunity to bounce ideas off others and get feedback on my work. So, for my next project, I formed a cross-functional team that included members with different areas of expertise. This allowed us to develop more innovative and effective solutions than any one person could have on their own.

Overall, I believe that both independent work and collaboration are important in achieving success. I am flexible and adaptable and can thrive in either setting.

### Example 2:

I enjoy working as part of a team, as I find it enables me to leverage the strengths and expertise of others to produce better results. Working collaboratively allows me to bounce ideas off others and get feedback on my work, which helps me improve and grow as a professional.

That being said, I also value independence in my work. I find that having autonomy over my tasks and projects allows me to work at my own pace and focus deeply on the task at hand.

Ultimately, I believe that a balance of both styles is ideal. In my previous roles, I have found that a mix of teamwork and independent work produces the best results. I am open to working in either style and am confident that I can be successful in a variety of settings.
