### Example 1

In my previous role, I managed a software development project with significant customer involvement. The customer was a large financial institution that required custom software to manage their investment portfolio.

Throughout the project, I emphasized open and ongoing communication with the customer, including regular check-ins to ensure that the project met their expectations. I listened actively to their feedback and provided clear articulation on our progress, timelines and any issues that arose.

The project faced several challenges, including changing requirements and competing priorities from different stakeholders. However, by maintaining positive communication with the customer and keeping them informed of changes, we were able to address these issues while still meeting their needs.

Ultimately, the project was a success, and we delivered the software on time and within budget. The customer was pleased with the final product and the positive working relationship we had developed.

From this experience, I learned the importance of maintaining open communication with customers and stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle. Going forward, I would prioritize regular check-ins and clear articulation to ensure that all parties are informed and engaged in the project.
