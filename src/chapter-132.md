Sample Answers

### Example 1

I was working as a sales representative for a software company, and I was trying to sell a new software tool to a potential client. The client was hesitant to purchase the tool due to concerns about the cost and implementation process. To address these objections, I listened carefully to their concerns and empathized with their position. I then provided them with case studies and testimonials from other clients who had successfully implemented the tool and seen significant improvements in their operations. Finally, I offered a free trial period so that they could test the tool before committing to a purchase. Ultimately, we were able to make the sale, and the client was very satisfied with the tool's performance.

### Example 2

In a previous sales role, I was tasked with selling a new product to an existing customer who was hesitant to make a purchase due to concerns about the product's effectiveness. To address their objections, I first asked questions to understand their specific needs and pain points. I then provided them with detailed information about the product's features and benefits, highlighting how it addressed their specific concerns. To address their concerns about the product's effectiveness, I offered a money-back guarantee if they were not satisfied with the product's performance. As a result of my approach, we were able to make the sale, and the customer became a loyal repeat customer.

Remember, when answering interview questions about selling despite objections, provide context for the situation, explain your approach, highlight the outcome, and show empathy towards the customer or client's concerns. Show that you have effective persuasion and objection handling skills and can adapt your approach to meet the needs of different customers or clients.
