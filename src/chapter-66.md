Sample Answers

### Example 1

In my previous role as a project manager, I experienced a conflict between two team members who had different ideas about how to approach a critical task. I first addressed the issue privately with each team member to understand their perspective and concerns. Then, I facilitated a group meeting to encourage open communication and collaboration. During the meeting, I actively listened to their viewpoints and encouraged them to consider alternative approaches. We were able to come up with a solution that incorporated both ideas and satisfied both team members. As a result, the project was completed successfully and on time, and the team members continued to work effectively together.

### Example 2

In a previous role, I worked with a colleague who consistently missed deadlines, causing delays in the project timeline. I first addressed the issue privately with my colleague, expressing my concerns and asking for their perspective. We identified some underlying issues that were causing the delays, such as competing priorities and unclear expectations. I then worked with my colleague to develop a plan to address the issues, which included setting clear goals and timelines, providing additional resources and support, and monitoring progress. As a result of our collaboration, we were able to improve communication and better manage expectations, resulting in improved project outcomes and a more positive working relationship.

Remember, when answering interview questions about your experience with conflict resolution, be sure to provide an example of how you successfully resolved a conflict in the workplace, describe the situation, explain your approach, highlight the outcome, and demonstrate the conflict resolution skills you used.
